# Overview
This project focuses on performing image segmentation using the U-Net architecture on the CARLAS Self-Driving Car dataset. The primary goal is to accurately segment images into 23 different classes, contributing to the development of advanced perception systems for autonomous vehicles
# Dataset
The model is trained on the CARLAS Self-Driving Car dataset, which includes a diverse set of images representative of scenarios encountered by autonomous vehicles.
# Training
The U-Net model is trained on the dataset using TensorFlow's Keras API. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters to achieve high accuracy in segmenting images. 
# Results
The trained U-Net model demonstrates a remarkable accuracy of 94.73% on the validation set after just 10 epochs. Training for more than 50 epochs tend to give the best results, further fine-tuning and optimization can be explored for even better performance.
